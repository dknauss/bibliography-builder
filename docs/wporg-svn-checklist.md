# WordPress.org SVN Deploy Checklist

This repository uses Git for development and WordPress.org SVN for release publication.

## Checklist

1. **Keep Git as the source of truth**
   - Develop in GitHub.
   - Use SVN only for WordPress.org release publication.

2. **Use the correct WordPress.org SVN identity**
   - SVN username must be the WordPress.org username used for the plugin.
   - The username is case-sensitive.
   - Use the SVN-specific password from WordPress.org account settings, not the normal account password.

3. **Update `trunk/` with release-ready code**
   - `trunk/` should contain the current release baseline.
   - Do not place the main plugin file inside a nested subfolder under `trunk/`.

4. **Keep assets in `/assets/`**
   - Screenshots, banners, and icons belong in `assets/`.
   - The WordPress.org Preview blueprint belongs at `assets/blueprints/blueprint.json`; in this repository that source file is `.wordpress-org/blueprints/blueprint.json`.
   - Keep the WordPress.org Preview blueprint aligned with `playground/blueprint.json`.
   - Both blueprints must request PHP `intl` using `phpExtensionBundles: ["kitchen-sink"]` and `features: { "networking": true, "intl": true }` so the browser Playground runtime can run the `citeproc-php` formatter.
   - Do not commit development-only files there.

5. **Tag releases from `trunk/`**
   - Create release tags by copying `trunk/` into `tags/<version>/` using SVN copy.
   - Update `Stable tag:` in `trunk/readme.txt` when tagging.

6. **Do not upload zip files to SVN**
   - Commit individual files only.
   - Keep the packaged GitHub release zip separate from SVN.

7. **Treat SVN as a public release repository**
   - Only commit finished changes that are safe for WordPress.org users.
   - Anything committed to SVN should be ready to ship.

8. **If authentication fails, check these first**
   - Username capitalization/case.
   - Whether the account is listed as a plugin committer.

## Repository workflow summary

- **GitHub release zip**: packaged artifact for GitHub Releases and Playground.
- **WordPress.org SVN `trunk/`**: public release source.
- **WordPress.org `assets/`**: directory screenshots, banner, and icon assets.
- **Playground blueprints**: `playground/blueprint.json` powers GitHub/readme demo links; `.wordpress-org/blueprints/blueprint.json` deploys to SVN `assets/blueprints/blueprint.json` for the plugin-directory Preview button.
- **WordPress.org `tags/<version>/`**: release snapshot.

## Playground preview verification

After editing either Blueprint, run:

```bash
npm run test -- --runTestsByPath src/blueprint.test.js
```

For a browser/WASM smoke check, launch the GitHub demo link and add the sample citations. The formatter REST response must not return `bibliography_builder_formatter_extension_missing`; the success notice should say citations were added without the fallback warning.


## Translation count and language-pack wording

WordPress.org's plugin page treats English (US) as the source language and counts only approved generated language packs as translated locales. If the public sidebar says "Languages: English (US) and Russian" while the Development tab says "translated into 1 locale," that means one translated locale is published and English (US) is the source language.

Do not describe bundled PO/MO seed files as official language availability. WordPress.org may import shipped `.mo` files into translate.wordpress.org, but a locale appears as an official language pack only after the Stable plugin translation reaches the approval threshold and a language pack is generated. The plugin page's live **Languages** list is the canonical public availability signal.
