## [Unreleased]

No changes yet.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- Explicitly enable Playground `features.intl` in both the GitHub demo blueprint and the WordPress.org Preview blueprint while retaining `phpExtensionBundles: ["kitchen-sink"]`, because the live browser Playground runtime requires the feature flag for `citeproc-php` formatter requests to load PHP `intl` reliably.
- Switch the GitHub demo blueprint to install Borges through the WordPress.org plugin resource instead of a GitHub Release asset URL, avoiding browser CORS failures in live Playground.

### Changed

- Clarify translation documentation so bundled seed PO/MO files are not confused with official WordPress.org language packs.

### Tests

- Add regression coverage that requires both Blueprint files to request `intl` through both supported Playground configuration forms.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- Use the WordPress `apiFetch` helper for editor formatter REST requests so authenticated editor sessions include the expected REST nonce handling.
- Add the WordPress.org Playground preview blueprint at `assets/blueprints/blueprint.json` with the `kitchen-sink` PHP extension bundle so the PHP formatter can load `intl` in previews.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- DOI and BibTeX input parsing via citation-js.
- Supported formatted citation input for books, articles, chapters, webpages, reviews, and theses.
- Manual entry with structured fields and per-type validation.
- Nine citation styles: Chicago Notes-Bibliography (default), Chicago Author-Date, APA 7, MLA 9, Harvard, Vancouver, IEEE, OSCOLA, and ABNT.
- Automatic alphabetical sorting per style rules.
- Duplicate detection across paste and manual entry.
- Static save with semantic HTML (`role="doc-bibliography"`, `<cite>` wrappers, `lang` attributes, and no deprecated bibliography-entry ARIA role in newly saved output).
- Schema.org JSON-LD structured data output (on by default).
- Optional CSL-JSON machine-readable output.
- Optional COinS metadata for citation manager detection.
- Reference-manager friendly metadata and exports for Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote, JabRef, BibDesk, LaTeX, and CSL/citeproc workflows.
- Export: Download CSL-JSON, UTF-8 BibTeX, RIS; copy per-entry or full bibliography.
- Read-only REST API for programmatic bibliography access.
- Editor UI with paste zone, manual entry, per-entry edit/delete, and keyboard accessibility.
- Block-local Gutenberg notices with focus management.
- Structured per-field editing for heuristic or warning-marked citations.
- Lazy-loaded CSL style templates.
- XSS prevention: HTML escaping for citation text, `</` escaping in script blocks, HTML tag stripping from CrossRef metadata.
- Input caps: 50 entries per paste, 1 MB max input size.
- GitHub Actions CI: lint, test, build, PHPUnit, Psalm, CodeQL, Codecov, Playwright Playground smoke tests, runtime matrix.
- Multisite runtime smoke coverage with network activation on an Apache/PHP/latest-WordPress lane.
- Release workflow with tag-triggered GitHub Release and zip artifact, plus WordPress.org release packaging with third-party notices.
- WordPress Playground blueprint for instant evaluation.
- Lifecycle end-to-end tests for activate, deactivate, and delete flows.
- Lifecycle CI coverage.
- Refined WordPress.org branding assets, including updated banner and icon artwork.
- Bundled interface locale files for French, German, Dutch, Swedish, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Korean, Serbian, Croatian, Brazilian Portuguese, Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, and Telugu.
- 25 additional regression tests covering REST defaults, structured-edit cancellation races, focus helper behavior, manuscript/review italics branches, BibTeX aliases, thesis COinS output, and corrected JSON-LD mappings.
- New dedicated hook test files for `use-citation-editor-state` and `use-entry-focus`.
- PHP utility-function tests for REST/export helper behavior, formatter normalization, block collection, and JSON encoding.

### Changed

- Improved reset icon from minus to counterclockwise arrow for clarity.
- BibTeX exports preserve Unicode quotation marks instead of TeX quote ligatures for cleaner Zotero, Mendeley, and BibTeX-family imports.
- `aria-label` on bibliography section now matches custom heading text when set.
- Added an accessible name to citation entry buttons.
- Added `role="region"` and `aria-label` to the editor notice container.
- Added `prefers-reduced-motion` override for action button transitions.
- Added `focus-visible` outline to bibliography list entries.
- Removed the redundant `aria-label` from the inline edit input.
- Aligned WordPress.org-facing package identifiers around the approved `borges-bibliography-builder` slug while preserving the existing block namespace and saved CSS classes for content/theme compatibility.
- Normalized GitHub, Playground, Plugin URI, security-reporting, and language-header URLs around `dknauss/borges-bibliography-builder`.
- Standardized the first public release package on `borges-bibliography-builder.zip` with no transition zip.
- Removed dead exports and branches in the parser and style registry, including the unused `SUPPORTED_INPUT_MESSAGE` re-export and experimental style-picker path.
- Psalm failures now block CI instead of running with `continue-on-error`.
- Playwright smoke tests now use configurable frontend and REST paths through `SMOKE_FRONTEND_PATH` and `SMOKE_REST_PATH`.

### Security

- Overrode the vulnerable transitive development dependency `basic-ftp` to the patched release.

### Fixed

- REST responses now treat `outputJsonLd` as enabled when the attribute is absent from stored block attributes, matching the block default for older or migrated blocks.
- Structured edit cancellation now guards both before and after bibliography formatting resolves, preventing stale formatted data from being committed after a late cancel.
- The PHPUnit `wp_strip_all_tags()` stub now matches WordPress behavior and no longer collapses whitespace, exposing plain-text rendering bugs more accurately.
- `jsonld.js` now maps chapter citations with a container title to `isPartOf: { @type: "Book" }`, and maps `review-book` to `Review`.
- `coins.js` now emits dissertation-specific COinS metadata for thesis citations instead of falling back to the journal format.
- ABNT formatter normalization now collapses duplicate page markers such as `p. p.` and `p. pp.`.
